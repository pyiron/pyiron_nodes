"""Utility functions for simple geometric analysis of atomic structures.

The functions in this module are intentionally lightweight and have no external
dependencies beyond ``numpy`` and ``ase``.  They are useful in workflows where
one needs to extract bond lengths and bond angles for water molecules from an
ASE ``Atoms`` object.

Only O–H bonds and the H‑O‑H angle are calculated – this matches the canonical
definition of a water molecule.  The algorithm is tolerant of structures that
contain multiple water molecules, as long as the O atoms are correctly identified
by their chemical symbol ``"O"`` and the H atoms by ``"H"``.

    """Compute O–H bond lengths and H‑O‑H angles for water molecules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    structure:
        ASE ``Atoms`` object containing one or more water molecules.
    cutoff:
        Distance (Å) used to decide whether an O–H pair belongs to the same
        molecule.  A typical O–H bond length in water is ~0.96 Å, so a cutoff of
        1.2 Å safely captures bonded pairs while excluding non‑bonded H atoms.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        ``{"bonds": [(O_idx, H_idx, distance), ...],
        "angles": [(O_idx, H1_idx, H2_idx, angle_deg), ...]}``
        where ``O_idx``/``H_idx`` are the atom indices in the original ASE
        object, ``distance`` is the O–H bond length in Å and ``angle_deg`` the
        H‑O‑H angle in degrees.

    Notes
    -----
    The function does **not** attempt to verify chemical connectivity beyond the
    distance criterion.  If an oxygen atom has fewer or more than two hydrogen
    neighbours within the cutoff, only the available bonds are reported and the
    angle is omitted for that oxygen.
